;;; Commentary:

;; initchart.el provides macros and functions to measure and visualize a init
;; process of Emacs.
;; 
;; First, one need to record the execution time of some primary functions such
;; as 'load' and 'require'.  Use the macro 'initchart-record-execution-time-of'
;; at the beginning of your init.el to register functions of concern, and then
;; launch an Emacs process as usual.  Execution time of the registered functions
;; will be logged in the '*Messages*' buffer.
;; 
;; Then, you can visualize these logs by invoking the command
;; 'initchart-visualize-init-sequence', which will ask you the filepath to save
;; an output SVG image.
;; 
;; Example:
;;   (require 'initchart)
;;   (initchart-record-execution-time-of load file)
;;   (initchart-record-execution-time-of require feature)

;;; Code:
